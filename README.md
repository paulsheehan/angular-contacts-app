# MifinityAngularTest

Simple Agnular app to manage (CRUD) contacts on a mock API (json-server)

## Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start dev server. Angular app and json-server are ran simultaneously. Angular app can be found on `http://localhost:4200/`. json-server can accessed on http://localhost:3000. Please wait for the Angular App to build, otherwise you will get a "This site can't be reached" error while the site is building.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
